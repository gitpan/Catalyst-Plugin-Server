Revision history for Perl extension Catalyst::Plugin::XMLRPC

0.28  Thu Jul 08 20:30:00 CEST 2010 
===================================
* Upgrade the plugin for Catalyt 5.8 series
* Changes for adopting MRO::compat where not complete. Calls to next::method
  instead of NEXT::...()
* Change name of paths and compiled base class properties in Cat 5.8
* Clone the result before serializing, as RPC::XML won't clone already seen
  refs (thanks t0m)
* Fix the test suite (some tests were lost from 0.24->0.26)
* Don't warn about the breakage of XML::RPC, as the author has already
  fixed the backcompat breakage

===================================
* Important notice: RPC::XML 0.69 introduced a backwards incompatible
